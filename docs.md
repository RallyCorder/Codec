## Foreword
This program is here to assist you. It's purpose is to facilitate tedial tasks. The software is for you to use and tinker. You'll need basic knowledge of how to interact with a terminal and how to read a configuration file.

## Design Philosophy
My idea when first thinking of this software was quite simple. I often needed to check whether I was actually connected to Internet, but every time I needed to open a terminal and ping a website. I thought 'I would really like something I can just click and know if I'm connected'. As it happens, I had been working on another project with the Qt framework. As so, I started building. I had in mind that I **didn't** want a Bonzi Buddy, obviously no telemetry but especially not in the way of the user, something that I hold a strong stance against. I wanted something that would allow me to do functions I often need to do swiftly through a simple menu. Some time ago, I played Neon Genesis Evangelion: Kotetsu No Girlfriend, an *old*-ish game visual novel for Windows98; in the game, dialogues happen with windows who pop in and out showing character sprites with subtitles appearing underneath. I found it charming, and thought that I would like my little assistant program to look as so. The name itself is inspired by Metal Gear Solid, who was also an inspiration for this project.
