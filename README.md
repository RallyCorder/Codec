*Inspired by the dialog boxes of 『新世紀エヴァンゲリオン鋼鉄のガールフレンド』*

The program aims to allow swift interactions with graphical feedback

## Project notes
- Likely based on Qt
- Should stay out of the way of the user
- Bonzi buddy, but without the malware and annoying pings
- Easy customisability
- Compatibility with other OS' and DEs'
- Subtitles at the bottom of the screen
- NO WINDOW BORDERS
