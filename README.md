*Inspired by the dialog boxes of 『新世紀エヴァンゲリオン鋼鉄のガールフレンド』*

The program aims to allow swift interactions with graphical feedback

## Roadmap
- Add user precised terminal commands
- A visual SSH picker


## Project notes
- Likely based on Qt
- Should stay out of the way of the user
- Bonzi buddy, but without the malware and annoying pings
- Compatibility with other OS' and DEs'
- Subtitles at the bottom of the screen
- NO WINDOW BORDERS
- Make it so that end users can get auto-suggested
- Command modules

## !For Wayland Users!
Due to how Wayland's protocol functions currently, moving the windows automatically isn't possible yet. I'm currently trying to find a way to resolve the issue, but I'm mostly relying on new Qt and Wayland additions. You may need to tinker with your DE's config to make the software function.
